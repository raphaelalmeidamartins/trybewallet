## :page_with_curl: About

React project developed by [Raphael Martins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelameidamartins/) at the end of Unit 15 ([Front-end Development Module](https://github.com/raphaelalmeidamartins/trybe_exercicios/tree/main/2_Desenvolvimento-Front-end)) of Trybe's Web Development course. I was approved with 100% of the mandatory and optional requirements met.

We had to develop a wallet React application using the React Router, Redux and fetching currency exchange rates from a public API.

### Note

This project is still under development. I am implementing the layout, and I will refactor the code. I haven't deployed the application yet.

### In progress

- [ ] Finishing CSS
- [ ] Adding English translation (the project is currently only available in Brazilian Portuguese)
